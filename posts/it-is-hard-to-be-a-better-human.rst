Being a better human being is a hard task. I know it because I try to be a better person. Day after day. And I just can't.

Of course I would love to write a long post about how I evolved from a disgusting to an awesome person people like to speak with. I am not this kind of person.

But yeah, take note: I am getting better at it.

After some conversaton with a friend of mine I recognized some bad characteristics of myself. It was a pleasure to know what I am doing wrong. What sort of things I can do better. And last but not least the things people respect about me.

Making efforts to better understand people around me is my contribution to make this world a little bit better. Try it! Try it now... I promise you are going to be a better human understanding the wars people are fighting.
